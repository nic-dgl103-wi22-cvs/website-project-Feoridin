            <h2>Cleaning For Your Ceramic Braces Amid Quarantine</h2><br>
            <a><img src="Images/FRONTPAGE/DENTALCLINCDAPITANDIPOLOGL.jpg" alt="Dental Clinic Dapitan Dipolog blog2" width="700"></a>
            <p>Braces are one of the top dental procedures when it comes to straightening misaligned bites, eliminating gaps between pearly whites, and helping achieve a more 
                aesthetically pleasing smile. One of the most common types is traditional braces. These are made of gray or metallic silver brackets and wires. It also uses 
                different colors of rubber - making it more noticeable in one's teeth. Meanwhile, ceramic braces are also getting more popular in the Philippines as they also g
                ive the benefits of conventional braces but with a more discrete look. It is made of high-grade polycrystalline ceramic that blends into the color of the teeth. 
                However, these ceramic braces and clear elastics are highly susceptible to color degradation.</p>
            <p>To feel confident while wearing ceramic braces, you should maintain it clean and white just like your teeth. But with the implemented community quarantine due to
                 the COVID-19 threat, visiting a dentist to regularly clean and adjust your braces is challenging. Many clinics are closed due to the issued social distancing 
                 guidelines and lockdown policies. To help you in cleaning and maintaining the integrity of your braces even at home, here are the following tips that you can 
                 practice:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Regularly brush your teeth.</strong><br>
                <p>This is a no-brainer but a crucial move not only to keep your braces at its best but also to maintain your oral cavity&apos;s good health. Gently brush your teeth
                     with a soft-bristled toothbrush every after a meal instead of just twice a day to prevent bacteria from building up and developing into hard-to-remove plaque.
                      Avoid using whitening toothpaste as these usually contain strong chemicals and abrasive ingredients that may stain and damage your ceramic braces.
                       Ask your dentist for recommendation too.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Floss and rinse.</strong><br>
                <p>Study shows that brushing can only remove about 25% of bacteria, sugar and acids in your oral cavity. There are many hard-to-reach areas and that&apos;s why 
                    flossing and rinsing with mouthwash are important. Flossing rubs off the plaque stuck between your teeth and your ceramic braces. Meanwhile, using a 
                    mouthwash flushes out stain-causing bacteria and reduces the risk of gingivitis, keeping your ceramic braces white, and your gums healthy for faster 
                    orthodontic treatment.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Be mindful of your diet.</strong><br>
                <p>Common dental braces staining agents are found in coffee, tea, hot chocolate, red foods, and curry dishes. As per dentists in the Philippines, these acidic 
                    flavor stains stick to your ceramic braces even longer and are difficult to remove especially when you consume them regularly. To prevent this, curb your 
                    consumption so you do not have to forego you favorite food and beverages altogether. It is also best to quit smoking as your teeth are compromised when in 
                    braces, and smoking or chewing tobacco only compromises them further. Nicotine also stains teeth and braces badly. Start cutting down and then quitting 
                    altogether for your ceramic braces not to go to waste.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Continue to consult your dentist.</strong></li><br>
                <p>Amid quarantine, dentists in the Philippines still carry out online consultation to help their patients care for their ceramic braces even at home. Don&apos;t be
                     shy to ask your dentist for recommendations especially when oral cavity problems arise. Some are even willing to schedule appointments and open their 
                     clinics for their patients in need. Make sure you have your dentist&apos;s contact number with you. Remember, professionals know best when it comes to 
                     ceramic braces and oral health maintenance.</p>
